# mrmarkuz NS8 repository

This is the mrmarkuz NS8 app beta testing repository. The goal is to move the apps to [NS8 Forge](https://forge.nethserver.org) when they have reached a good level of quality.

To install the apps via Software Center from this NS8 repository, see the [manual
page](https://docs.nethserver.org/projects/ns8/en/latest/software_center.html#software-repositories)
and set the following URL:

    https://repo.mrmarkuz.com/ns8/updates/

Alternative URL in case the first one isn't working:
